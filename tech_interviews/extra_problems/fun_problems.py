"""
Question 1
Given an integer array of length N and an int t , find all good tuples.
A good tuple is defined as A[i] < A[j] < A[k] and A[i] + A[j] + A[k] <= t. 
Return the number of tuples

Question 2
Given an array of non negative integers,length n, find all pairs (i,j) where A[i] + rev(A[j]) = rev(A[i]) + A[j].
The rev() function is the reverse of the integer i.e rev(456) = 654.
Return the number of pairs

Question 3
Given an integer n, find the sum n + rev(n). 
The rev() function reverses the integer but also keeps track of the beginning zero
i.e rev(4200) = 2400 , rev(301) = 103. 
Return the sum

Question 4
Given a 2D array of integers and an int k, 
find the k x k sub-matrix that has the max sum and 
return the sum of all the unique integers in the sub-matrix.
If there are more than one sub-matrices with the max sum their values should be included in the result.
