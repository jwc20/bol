# Questions to ask myself

### Before

#### Constraints?

	- What is the input? What is the output?
	- Is the input sorted?
	- If we're working with numbers, are we working with working with only nonnegative numbers?
	- Should I return empty list or 0 or -1 or some boolean if the input not valid (if input is empty string, list, etc)?


#### Ideas and assumptions:

	- ***What is the simplest, most naive solution?***
	- What other solutions can I come up with?
		- Can I come up with a better solution or should build on the naive solution?
	- What are the time and space complexity of the solutions I am not working with?
	- What is the time and space complexity of the solution I am working with?


### During

- Is my pseudocode and/or explanation be understood by a 5 year old?
- Can I convince the 5 year old that my idea works?
- What test cases am I going to use?
	- Did I make sure that my tests are explicitly tested on paper and properly ran through?
	- Can I draw my solution out step-by-step using stack trace?
- Are there any edge cases?

- Am I keeping track of all the variables at each step? (Ex: print(i, A[i], A[i+1])

### After

- What were the steps that the optimal solution took from the book?
- Did I try and explore those steps?
- If I didn't explore those steps, what would it take for me to recognize that was the next step?

- When looking at my own solution, what were the toughts and paths I took that didnt lead to anything?
- How can I avoid these?
- What do I need to see first and how can I have better intuition to see the insight?

- If I didn't get the solution at all, what were the insights that I needed to get started?
- Is it logical and simple enough that anyone can figure out the step I got stuck on?

- Did I try to do a magic bullet or hail marys? Is there a logical train of thought that can rpevent me from doing so?


- What can I do to get the solution faster?
	- Why did it take too long?
	- What did I spend too long on?
	- Where did it take too long?

- Was there extra thoughts that did nothing? 
- Did I overemphasize this set of thoughts? 
- What did I not spend enough time on? 
- Could adding more time here help prevent mistakes that I made later? 
- Should I invest more time into this area to ensure I am at a lower risk of mistakes later on in this step?

- If it took too long, what could I have done to get the solution faster without sacrificing stability or safety?
- Why did I write this bad line of code? 
- Why was this comparison wrong? 
- Could I have planned this better? 
- What were the decisions that lead up to this bad code or bad line?
- Could I have made a better decision earlier up in the chain?

- What edge cases do I need to look out for?
- Could I have tested for this? 
- Was this obvious earlier on? 
- If there are too many edge cases, can I simplify my design and approach to be more systematic so I donâ€™t have to worry about remembering so many edge cases?

- Why was my solution bad?
- What went wrong?
- What can I do to avoid this in the future?
