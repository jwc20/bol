# ~~Journal~~ Captain's Log

## 7/2/22
- Went over all the problems in chapter 6 except for 6.7. 
- Had the general sense or idea of the solution but could not execute on the code to get it right.
- There are a number of methods used in the textbook that I need to learn. (functools, reduce, hexdigits, lambda, ...)

## 7/1/22
- Took a break.

## 6/30/22
- Writing codes on paper is overkill, just design algorithm on paper then code on keyboard.

## 6/29/22

- Went over all the problems in chapter 5 I've done so far.
- The ideas were correct but was inadequate in the actual coding and sometimes pseudocode.

## 6/28/22

- Dear diary, I got the wrong solution to EPI 5.5 again. Sned help.

## 6/27/22

- Looked over problems I did and did some research for my next project (edgar-fin-api). It seems that this project might take more time than I initially thought, so I'm not gonna do it.

## 6/26/22

- [Time track](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jy4TRW5geWFlUVqOwCHh32BZSAPPkbB3LgF2NXbsoaQ/edit?usp=sharing)

## 6/25/22

- Made this journal.

### TODO

- Derive a barebone skeleton of the patterns from EPI.
- Memorize it (for speed).
- Think back to the skeleton when finding a similar problem.
