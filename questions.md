# Questions to ask me


### Before Before

- Am I understanding the question correctly?
- Have I communicated effectively and quickly with the interviewer what my understanding of the question is?

### Before

#### Constraints?

- What is the input? What is the output?
- Is the input sorted?
- If we're working with numbers, are we working with only nonnegative numbers?
- Should I return an empty list or 0 or -1 or some boolean if the input is not valid (if the input is an empty string, list, etc.)?

#### Ideas and assumptions:

- ***What is the simplest, most naive solution?***
- What other solutions can I come up with?
	- Can I come up with a better solution, or should I build on the naive solution?
- What are the time and space complexity of the solutions I am not working with?
- What is the time and space complexity of the solution I am working with?

### During

- Is my pseudocode and explanation understood by a five-year-old?
- Can I convince the five-year-old that my idea works?
- What test cases am I going to use?
  - Did I ensure that my tests were explicitly tested on paper and adequately ran through?
  - Can I draw my solution out step-by-step using stack trace?
- Are there any edge cases?

- Am I keeping track of all the variables at each step? (Ex: print(i, A[i], A[i+1])

### After

- What were the steps that the optimal solution took from the book?
- Did I try and explore those steps?
- If I didn't explore those steps, what would it take for me to recognize that was the next step?

- When looking at my solution, what were the thoughts and paths I took that didn't lead to anything?
- How can I avoid these?
- What do I need to see first, and how can I have better intuition to see the insight?

- If I didn't get the solution, what were the insights I needed to get started?
- Is it logical and simple enough that anyone can figure out the step I got stuck on?

- Did I try to do a magic bullet or hail mary? Can a logical train of thought prevent me from doing so?

- What can I do to get the solution faster?

  - Why did it take too long?
  - What did I spend too long on?
  - Where did it take too long?

- Was there extra thoughts that did nothing?
- Did I overemphasize this set of thoughts?
- What did I not spend enough time on?
- Could adding more time here help prevent mistakes that I made later?
- Should I invest more time into this area to ensure I am at a lower risk of mistakes later in this step?

- If it took too long, what could I have done to get the solution faster without sacrificing stability or safety?
- Why did I write this lousy line of code?
- Why was this comparison wrong?
- Could I have planned this better?
- What decisions led up to this wrong code or lousy line?
- Could I have made a better decision earlier up in the chain?

- What edge cases do I need to look out for?
- Could I have tested for this?
- Was this obvious earlier on?
- If there are too many edge cases, can I simplify my design and approach to be more systematic, so I don't have to worry about remembering so many edge cases?

- Why was my solution inadequate?
- What went wrong?
- What can I do to avoid this in the future?
