#### 6/23/22

Update:

- Started doing something similar to the Leitner system,
- reduced resources used (still using leetcode discussion discussion when available),
- merged the EPIJudge(only Python files) fork with this repo, and
- started doing only the easy problems on EPI per chapter. Will come back for the medium/hard problems after going through all the chapters.
